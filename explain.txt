lThere are no meaningful changes to the room. This is not the normally used smots footage, however, it does a short climb jump off the little ledge when entering the room to the right, and skips the second spring by dashing upwards instead of left and lands on the 4th spring from the 3rd spring.
lThe modern, more commonly used footage of smots-8. The original.
uStill nothing changed. Madeline dashed into the block instead of holding it, and at the last part she neutral jumped on the second last block so it didn't fall.
uNothing changed. She dashed into a spring twice before continuing.

lThis episode starts off with the role information screen of a game of Among Us. Like a normal Among Us game, the players spawn in and begin walking off to do their tasks. The player character is named pink, and all the other players are also named colours corresponding to their player colour. After walking to medbay and opening a task menu, an emergency meeting is called. All players say "smots gaming" in chat except for red, who says "what are you talking about?". All other players immediately vote red off, causing them to be ejected. However, they are ejected into footage of smots-8, instead of the normal space background.
lThe time slows down as Madeline charge up her speed, and she finished the room in less than 1 second, seemingly a refernce to The Flash.
lI wanna Atone the Flower room 13 in smots-8 style. On attempt 247 Madeline beats the room and get teleported to smots-9. This is also how many times a player named issy or mystral fox got to the last jump before beating the room.
lInstead of the room, there is a desert seeker from the map 5b funny version by ninz, carrying Madeline and tell her fun facts. Here are all the fun facts the desert seeker said: "smots-8's room dimensions are 200x23", "There are 8 springs in smots-8. Coincidence?", "The desert seeker is from 5b funny version by ninz", "The "rightstrong" wind in the room option is different from the "rightstrong" wind trigger.", "There are 240 foreground tiles in smots-8", "smots gaming is run by [the video is cut off]",

lThis episode is an IRL video, There are baked christmas cookies with all kinds of different frosting designs and shapes. (while some of them are hard to see, the ones we were able to recognize will be listed here in order of apparition: a red candy cane, a white butterfly, a white character with a brown mustache, blue eyes and a yellow crown, an unfrosted candy cane, a yellow and orange bell, an unfrosted arrow tip, a white gingerbread man, two ice cream cones, a blue dino, a blue snowflake, a blue kite, a blue gingerbread man, a mountain? (maybe celeste mountain?), 3 blue butterflies, an orange butterfly, another gingerbread character (this one kinda reminds me of freddy), a giant faceless ginerbread person, a green butterfly and one last blue and red guy. There are also a lot of stars, trees, boots and flowers that I didn't want to name because there are way too many of them) On the last rack there is a smots-8 star-shaped cookie and a flamingo cookie, as the camera pans past all the cookies, and Undertale's "Uwa, so holiday!" plays. It suddenly reverses and slowly zooms into the smots cookie, then switches to the flamingo cookie. The video then transitions into a slide showing pictures of flamingos with the text saying "Happy international flamingo day!", while [a variation of the same song](https://youtu.be/HBfUVatdNJ8?si=NtbjFcVv-aaxLmzq) plays. At the last second of the video, a wind sound effect plays, reminding us that this is a smots gaming video.
lIn the middle of smots-8 the Batman intro (1966) plays, except the name bat man is replaced with smots gaming, Madeline west instead of Adam west, Final Goodbye instead of Robin's actor, the executive producer is Parrot Dash, it also stars "Wind Springs Hamilton" and Maddy Thorson EXOK Games. In the background, it plays smots-8 footage while the foreground is the batman intro.
