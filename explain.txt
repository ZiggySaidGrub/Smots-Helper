lThere are no meaningful changes to the room. This is not the normally used smots footage, however, it does a short climb jump off the little ledge when entering the room to the right, and skips the second spring by dashing upwards instead of left and lands on the 4th spring from the 3rd spring.
lThe modern, more commonly used footage of smots-8. The original.
lStill nothing changed. Madeline dashed into the block instead of holding it, and at the last part she neutral jumped on the second last block so it didn't fall.
lThe same normal smots-8 footage except the dash into the third spring twice, and after the two up dashes at the end, she does an upright to get to smots-9.




lThis episode is normal smots gaming footage except the 3rd spring was hit twice, a right dash instead of upright through the spinners, and they ran out of stamina while climbing the last two blocks instead of updashes.












lThis is completely normal smots-8 footage except there is no freeze frames at all, and at the end they dash up right to land on the falling platforms instead of climbing them and then when they reach the top they perform the signature two updashes.
lIt's normal smots-8 footage except at 12 seconds a single snowball flies across the screen.

lSmots-8 but there are badeline bosses throughout the room that push madeline back when hit, this allows for skips or setbacks/time losses throughout the room.

lSmots-8 footage is now a desmos recreation with the circles being the spinners,  brown rectangles are springs, dark blue rectangles are spikes, black rectangles are moon blocks, and the color changing rectangle is Madeline hitbox with the corresponding hair color depending on how many dashes left.

lIn this episode, it shows that one video with the original caption, "97 year old NYC diner still serves their Coke the old-fashioned way." but Coke is replaced with smots, and the thing they are using to make the Coke is covered with a smots-8 room video.





lThis episodes starts with a normal clear of smots-8, though there is a wallbounce done after the first spring, which isn't typical. Near the end of the clear, the video fades into an IRL video of a computer screen, with smots-8 being currently played. It slowly zooms out. Youtuber GD Colon's plushie is seen to the right of the screen, and a second monitor is seen to the left, with wallpaper from the game Rhythm Doctor. As the video finished zooming out, The same Youtuber is holding a controller, and finishes beating smots-8. He then turns around and says "Hi, it's me, smots gaming. You might know me from my second channel, GD Colon. I just wanted to thank you so much for enjoying my smots gaming content, and I can guarantee you we've got lots more hilarious smots on the way."





































lThe secret 26th golden in the 2024 golden advent calendar is the critically acclaimed room smots-8.
lThis episode starts off with the role information screen of a game of Among Us. Like a normal Among Us game, the players spawn in and begin walking off to do their tasks. The player character is named pink, and all the other players are also named colours corresponding to their player colour. After walking to medbay and opening a task menu, an emergency meeting is called. All players say "smots gaming" in chat except for red, who says "what are you talking about?". All other players immediately vote red off, causing them to be ejected. However, they are ejected into footage of smots-8, instead of the normal space background.
lThe time slows down as Madeline charge up her speed, and she finished the room in less than 1 second, seemingly a refernce to The Flash.
lI wanna Atone the Flower room 13 in smots-8 style. On attempt 247 Madeline beats the room and get teleported to smots-9. This is also how many times a player named issy or mystral fox got to the last jump before beating the room.
lInstead of the room, there is a desert seeker from the map 5b funny version by ninz, carrying Madeline and tell her fun facts. Here are all the fun facts the desert seeker said: "smots-8's room dimensions are 200x23", "There are 8 springs in smots-8. Coincidence?", "The desert seeker is from 5b funny version by ninz", "The "rightstrong" wind in the room option is different from the "rightstrong" wind trigger.", "There are 240 foreground tiles in smots-8", "smots gaming is run by [the video is cut off]",
lThe user opens Firefox and googles "how to pronounce smots". when pronounce is clicked, it plays the wind from smots-8, but when played slow it plays the full smots-8 audio
lThis episode is an IRL video, There are baked christmas cookies with all kinds of different frosting designs and shapes. (while some of them are hard to see, the ones we were able to recognize will be listed here in order of apparition: a red candy cane, a white butterfly, a white character with a brown mustache, blue eyes and a yellow crown, an unfrosted candy cane, a yellow and orange bell, an unfrosted arrow tip, a white gingerbread man, two ice cream cones, a blue dino, a blue snowflake, a blue kite, a blue gingerbread man, a mountain? (maybe celeste mountain?), 3 blue butterflies, an orange butterfly, another gingerbread character (this one kinda reminds me of freddy), a giant faceless ginerbread person, a green butterfly and one last blue and red guy. There are also a lot of stars, trees, boots and flowers that I didn't want to name because there are way too many of them) On the last rack there is a smots-8 star-shaped cookie and a flamingo cookie, as the camera pans past all the cookies, and Undertale's "Uwa, so holiday!" plays. It suddenly reverses and slowly zooms into the smots cookie, then switches to the flamingo cookie. The video then transitions into a slide showing pictures of flamingos with the text saying "Happy international flamingo day!", while [a variation of the same song](https://youtu.be/HBfUVatdNJ8?si=NtbjFcVv-aaxLmzq) plays. At the last second of the video, a wind sound effect plays, reminding us that this is a smots gaming video.
lIn the middle of smots-8 the Batman intro (1966) plays, except the name bat man is replaced with smots gaming, Madeline west instead of Adam west, Final Goodbye instead of Robin's actor, the executive producer is Parrot Dash, it also stars "Wind Springs Hamilton" and Maddy Thorson EXOK Games. In the background, it plays smots-8 footage while the foreground is the batman intro.
lAt the middle of the level the song "Ruthlessness" from "EPIC: The Musical" plays at the drop and Madeline gets blown to the left
llt's the game A Hat In Time by Gears for Breakfast, here the player is glitching through the wall in the starting area by standing on top of the rail and using the "Boop!" emote in midair where Hat Kid is sligtly infront of the rail. This will cause him to glitch into the wall a bit and if you do a wall kick you can get inside the walls. The void outside is changed to be smots-8 footage while they walked around out of bounds and eventually stopped and danced until the footage ended.
lIn this episode it is normal smots-8 footage but when they get to the left dash to hit the second spring after bouncing on the third spring, it zooms closer to the second spring 3 times, playing the DUN DUN DUNNNNN sound effect. The room continues as normal until the end when they do an upright to skip climbing the platforms, when they land on top of the platforms they do the signature two updashes and make it to smots-9.
